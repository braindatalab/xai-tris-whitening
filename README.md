# XAI-Tris-Whitening

This repository contains all the experiments presented in the master thesis: *"Investigating the effect of whitening on AI explanation performance"*.

If one wishes to generate the xai-tris data without whitening, please go to https://github.com/braindatalab/xai-tris and follow the instructions there. The commands will be the same for both repositories.

For an example of how to run the commands to generate the whitened data, take a look at the `whitened_data_gen.ipynb` notebook in the notebooks folder.
